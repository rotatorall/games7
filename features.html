										In the early '90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series' existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it's here to stay as one of the preeminent players in the fighting game space. We caught up with series co-creator Ed Boon to talk about the series' bloody roots, its fascinating evolution, and its current status as one of the industry's heavy hitters.

										At the end of the day, I think you could think of it as it was four guys in their 20s, completely inspired by action movies of the '70s, '80s, and '90s, and just mashing up all of those ideas and "Wouldn't it be cool" moments into a fighting game, let loose and basically allowed to do what they wanted to do. You know, four guys in their 20s making a game, and nobody's telling them what to do. That's the result of what Mortal Kombat is.
