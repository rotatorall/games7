										During today's Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.
									</p>
									<p>
										We already received an overview of what to expect from Modern Warfare II back in June when we traveled to Infinity Ward to get our hands on the game (you can read our full impressions here). The information coming out of today's event was largely focused on the multiplayer offerings from this year's Call of Duty games. Both Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0 will use the same engine, which is developed specifically for current-generation consoles. Both experiences will also implement new A.I. advancements, including squadmate positioning, enemy patterns, and NPC and civilian movement that react dynamically to your actions.
									</p>

									<p>
										This year also represents advancements in the technology first introduced with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2019. The result is refined locomotion and A.I. models, and a physically based material system that allows for better photogrammetry, a new hybrid tile-based streaming system, new water and underwater rendering systems, better world volumetric lighting, 4K HDR, and a new GPU geometry pipeline.
